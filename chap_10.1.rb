#Shuffle. Now that youâ€™ve finished your new sorting algorithm, how about the opposite?
# Write a shuffle method that takes an array and returns a to- tally shuffled version.
# As always, youâ€™ll want to test it, but testing this one is trickier: How can you test
# to make sure you are getting a perfect shuffle? What would you even say a perfect
# shuffle would be? Now test for it.
