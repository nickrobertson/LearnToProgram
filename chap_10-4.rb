#Wedding number. How about wedding_number? It should work almost the same as english_number, except it should insert the word and all over the place, returning things like 'nineteen hundred and seventy and two', or however wedding invitations are supposed to look. I’d give you more examples, but I don’t fully understand it myself. You might need to contact a wedding coordinator to help you. (I’m really just kidding. You don’t have to do this one. I didn’t even do this one.)
